Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women. Breast cancer is a 

disease that occurs as a result of tumour formation by uncontrolled proliferation of 

some of the breast cell structures. In patients who are not diagnosed early, cancer 

spreads to other organs, making treatment difficult. In the diagnosis of breast cancer, 

the accuracy of pathological diagnosis is of great importance in order to shorten the 

decision-making process, minimise undetected cancer cells and get a faster diagnosis. 

For this reason, thanks to technological developments in the field of health, deep 

learning plays an important role in processing and analysing a large number of X-

Ray, MRI images. In this thesis, a deep learning model is proposed to detect breast 

cancer and distinguish two classes. These two classes are divided into benign and 

malignant.The benign ones are benign adenosis (BA), benign fibroadenoma (BF), 

benign phyllodes tumour (BPT), benign tubular adenoma (BTA) and the malignant 

ones are malignant ductal carcinoma (MDC), malignant lobular carcinoma (MLC), 

malignant mucinous carcinoma (MMC) and malignant papillary carcinoma (MPC).

Breast cancer MR images were binary classified as benign and malignant using the 

proposed CNN model with 3 deep learning models consisting of VGG16, MobileNet 

and ResNet50 trained on the ImageNet database obtained from the Kaagle platform. 

The images in the dataset have a size of 400X. The criteria used in the evaluation of 

all models are as follows: F1-Score, Recall, Precision, Accuracy.

Pre-processing on the dataset greatly helped the proposed CNN model and pre-

trained models in breast cancer detection and classification.
